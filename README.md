Basic Formatting
Increase the column widths to appropriate sizes so that they are readable

Format the header row in a suitable colour and put borders around the header row cells
Filtering
Filter the data by customer segment

Create four new worksheets, one for each customer segment

Copy raw data of each customer segment into the respective worksheet
Report Making - I
Freeze the header row

Delete or hide any unwanted columns

Hint: Decide judiciously between which columns should be deleted / hidden. Read the whole problem statement multiple times to figure this out.

Round off sales and profits to one decimal place

Format sales and profit in US dollar units

Format the Order Date and Ship Date into a more readable format (say 15-Jan 2012, or choose a format that you find the most readable)
Report Making - II
Sorting:

Sort alphabetically by Region

Within Region, sort alphabetically by Province

Within Province, sort in decreasing order of sales

Conditional Formatting - I:

Within each Region, within each Province, highlight the top 10% orders by sales in light green fill and dark green border

Conditional Formatting - II:

To help your manager understand profits better, highlight profits on a scale of green and losses on a scale of red (Higher the profit, darker the shade of green; More the loss, darker the shade of red).
Report Making - III
Apply double bottom borders to demarcate every Region
1. High-Profit Categories 

In this section, you want to identify the most profitable product sub-categories across each region. 

Using PIVOT Table, find the top 3 most profitable Product Sub-Categories in each region. 
Optional: Compare the profit for each of the top 3 profitable product subcategories by region:
Which subcategories are profitable in most regions?
Sort the rows and columns by profit and apply Conditional Formatting. Does this throw up some exceptions?
2. Loss Making Categories

Say you want to identify the least profitable (most loss-making) product subcategories and, if needed, stop selling those product subcategories in the regions where they are the least profitable.

Find the most loss-making Product Sub-Categories across all regions
For these subcategories, identify the regions where they are the least profitable
Optional: Articulate your observations and identify any anomalies that you observe
Food for thought: People mostly buy tables and chairs together; carefully analyse the business angle of these product categories and form hypotheses to explain your observations
